Hi. This is the inclusive package to run Ann's tuckshop. Please read this before installing and running the site. 
The installer package installs the Webserver (flask) and other dependencies on your pc.

IN ORDER TO RUN THIS SITE YOU MUST HAVE PYTHON INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER. THIS PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO RUN ON AND PYTHON 3. PYTHON 2.7 IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED AS IT LACKS SOME OF THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT IS REQUIRED.

!!!!!
Before using the installer or running the app, you must save the contents of this repo in a folder called "Anns Tuck Shop" on /desktop. This is necessary for the app to function. The file will unzip as "Annes_tuck_shop-master" THE INCLUDED RUN SCRIPTS WILL NOT RUN IF IT IS NOT ON THE DESKTOP WITH THAT NAME. If you want to run it without doing all this, you will need to navigate to the app directory via your terminal and run it from there.
!!!!!


Flask Installation Instructions
1- Open the folder that corresponds with your OS (i.e. MAC if you have MACOS or OSX, WINDOWS if you run windows)
2- Run the file called "Installer". 
3- Done!

Normal Operational Running Instructions
1- Open the folder that corresponds with your OS (i.e. MAC if you have MACOS or OSX, WINDOWS if you run windows)
2- Run the file called "run server". DO NOT RUN THE "RUN SERVER" FROM THE WRONG OS. IT WILL NOT RUN. ALSO IT IS ADVISED THAT YOU DO NOT USE THE DEVELOPMENTAL MODE SERVER.

The developmental version of the server is to be used when modifying and/or developing the source code of the project. The developmental version allows the server to automatically refresh whenever changes are made to the source code, and will reflect the changes immediately on the site. It will also run the debugger on the webpages, which may introduce vulnerabilities. 

The file containing the secret key is not included in this package. To protect privacy, the secret key will be generated automatically by the app when it is ran for the first time. You also have the option to purge the current secret key and obtain a new one with the purge command.
