A decade ago, the first things my family did at any family gathering was to ensure their technology was safely hidden away. Anyone failing to successfully secure their phones would discover that their devices would be in my possession, exploring and discovering the mysterious device in front of me. For as long as I can remember, I have always had a burning curiosity as to how technology worked and what drove the seemingly magical world of computing. My inquisitive nature propelled me to investigate the fundamentals of computers and to discover how computers are able to take electricity and change them into 1's and 0's which then are used to perform powerful calculations that powers software varying from my favourite video game to the word processor I write on. I was amazed at how software was able to work in conjunction with hardware and work in harmony. Eventually, I stumbled across the subject of Computer Science, and once I realised that there were a name and art for what I love, I set my mind to pursue this further. I discovered the power of using algorithmic thinking in real life and the more I explored the subject, the more I was able to connect the concepts of Computer Science to the outside world, and produce links between ideas that were supplemented into Computer Science into daily life. It was pleasantly surprising to realise that Mathematics and Physics were so intertwined with computing, with each area piggybacking off each other, enhancing and supplementing each other. This served only to strengthen my desire to explore more into the world of Computer Science; It was modelling real life. 
In 2012, I signed up to become a developer for both Apple's and Google's app programme allowing me to work with their developer tools and building an understanding of developer workflow. I wrote an iOS game which received a few hundred downloads. Furthermore, I ventured into Apple's World-Wide Developer Conference, and decided to actually attend one in 2015 in San Francisco, as a Young Coder Scholarships winner. While I was there, I learnt skills like how to optimise code, produce user-friendly systems and extensible code. By attending the developer conferences and watching WWDC, I keep on top of the latest innovations and advancements in technology, and satisfy my curiosity. At TransformUK, a company that consults businesses and develops digital solutions, I experienced the procedures and methods an IT-focused company works with and how they developed solutions. I witnessed directly the effects of Computing in the real world and it's impacts. It also let me to see the difference between the workflow and development of software development in workplaces against my own home projects. I attended a Robotics Residential Course at the University of Bath, where I focused on Graphical programming. During the stay there, I developed teamwork, as well as meeting new people. I also experienced student life and found it to be very desirable.
In 2017, I joined NCS, which developed me as an individual. It developed my confidence, and by working with a variety of people ,my teamwork was strengthened. My work ethic rose as I realised the impacts of my work on people lives. I then invested my time in various charity work such as volunteering at Springfield Elderly Care home, involving myself in projects for The Little Things (TLT), a charity develops medical care in 3rd world countries. As I volunteered, I was able to use computing to suggest and implement solutions for problems. I became more independent and improved my organisation as I gained experience in solving solutions. I returned this year to work as an Associate Mentor at NCS, where I worked alongside the Mentors to provide a safe, and fun environment to the Young People taking part. This developed my sense of responsibility and developed my self confidence as I talked in front of large audiences.
I completed DofE Silver and am currently completing Gold. I did a Practice Expedition in Snowdonia, where I stayed with random participants. I worked together with this team to have a successful expedition and made strong friendships during so. I've spent 8 years learning the Carnatic Violin, progressing on earning Distinction in my Diploma (grade 9), while I developed skills such as dedication, perseverance, discipline and dexterity. The very logical and defined patterns of the music and its structure supplemented my logical thinking from a young age. My passion for music also grew when I started self-teaching myself piano and guitar. My ability to self-teach allowed me to learn programming languages, which I have done by learning Java, Swift and BASIC, and I am currently learning C. As an avid swimmer, I completed a basic lifeguard course which allows me to work with a lifeguard. This has taught me responsibility and vigilance and work alongside like-minded dedicated people. Furthermore, I have taken upon myself to run a student 3D-Printing club aimed at year 7's and 8's where I am collaborating with younger students to produce various designs.	
As I progress into university, I want to integrate my different skills and assets to further improve my ability and to focus on improving myself. As someone who is genuinely interested and involved in computer science and wants to work on producing solutions, I need to go to university to better equip myself with the tools to progress further. I hope to enter the world of work to peruse a career in computer science and ultimately start a business in computer science.
